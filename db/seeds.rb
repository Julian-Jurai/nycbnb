The view from the rooftop jacuzzi and swimming pool were incredible! The rooms were modern and chic and, in fact, every bedroom had a view as well! We did a little bit of everything at the villa, swam a lot, played games, relaxed, took photos, watched movies, got plenty of massages. The kids had the best time of their lives. We did go out during our stay there, but even if we had not the villa offers lots of things to do. Last but not least, the staff was helpful and friendly.",
